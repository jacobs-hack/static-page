    <p>The jacobs<i>Hack</i>! event will take place on November 21st-22nd 2021 at: </p><br>

    <p>
        Jacobs University Bremen gGmbH<br>
        Campus Ring 1<br>
        28759 Bremen<br>
        Germany
    </p><br>

    <p>It is organized by a group of current and former students of Jacobs University. The main organizers are:</p><br>

    <p>
      <b>Denisa Checiu</b><br>
      <a href="mailto:d.checiu@jacobs-university.de">d.checiu@jacobs-university.de</a>
    </p><br>

    <p>
      <b>Daniela Tsayem</b><br>
      <a href="mailto:d.tsayem@jacobs-university.de">d.tsayem@jacobs-university.de </a>
    </p><br>

    <h1 class="text-xl font-bold" style="padding-bottom:25px;">jacobs<i>Hack</i>! Competition Rules</h1>
    
    <p>Tl;dr: During jacobs<i>Hack</i>!, you can work in a team of 1 - 4 people. You can work on anything you want, but will have to be fair and follow the MLH code of conduct. </p><br>

    <p>By attending, or applying to attend, jacobs<i>Hack</i>, each participant agrees to follow the following competition rules. </p><br>

    <ol class="c3 lst-kix_6h4uowo1d1r4-0 start" start="1">
        <li>
          Each participant must apply to jacobs<i>Hack</i> using the website. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Each participant must be part of a team. 
        </li>
        <li>
          There is no minimum team size (i.e. teams of one person are allowed), however, the maximum size is 4 people + 1 android. There will be 1 prize for each human member of the team, independently of the team size. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Teams should be made up exclusively of students (or recent graduates within one year of having graduated) who are not organizers, judges, sponsors, or in any other privileged position at the event.
        </li>
        <li>
          All team members should be present at the event and remote participation is not allowed. Leaving the venue for some time during the hack elsewhere or sleep is fine.
        </li>
        <li>Teams can use an idea they had before the event.</li>
        <li>
          Teams can work on ideas that have already been done. Hacks do not have to be &ldquo;innovative&rdquo;. If somebody wants to work on a common idea they should be allowed to do so and should be judged on the quality of their hack. These days it&rsquo;s hard to find something that&rsquo;s fully original and teams might not know an idea has been done before anyway.
        </li>
        <li>
          Teams can work on an idea that they have worked on before (as long as they do not re-use code).
        </li>
        <li>
          Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. Working on a project before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is not allowed.   
        </li>
        <li>
          Adding new features to existing projects is allowed. Judges will only consider new functionality introduced or new features added during the Hackathon in determining the winners.
        </li>
        <li>
          Teams must stop hacking once the time is up. However, teams are allowed to debug and make small fixes to their programs after time is up. e.g. If during demoing your hack you find a bug that breaks your application and the fix is only a few lines of code, it&#39;s okay to fix that. Making large changes or adding new features is not allowed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Teams must follow the <a class="c5" href="https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf">MLH Code of Conduct</a>. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Teams can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers&#39; discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules, breaking the Code of Conduct, or other unsporting behaviour.
        </li>
    </ol><br>

    <h1 class="text-xl font-bold" style="padding-bottom:25px;">Demos</h1>

    <p>Tl;dr: You should demo your hack by showing what it does, not by giving a presentation. </p><br>

    <p>After hacking finishes, teams will show their projects to each other and to the judges.</p><br>
    
    <p>You are strongly encouraged to present a demo of what you have built. Pitches or presentations are discouraged. You are not judged on the quality of your pitch or the quality of your idea. As you are judged on what you built, you&#39;ll only hurt yourself by not showing a demo.</p><br>

    <p>You are encouraged to present what you have done even if your hack is broken or you weren&rsquo;t able to finish. It&#39;s okay if you didn&#39;t finish your hack, that happens all the time! Completion is only one part of the judging criteria, so you might still do well. Also, demoing is not just about the competition. It&#39;s a chance to share with others what you learned and what you tried to build. That&#39;s what hacking&#39;s all about! In the case that you don&#39;t have anything to demo, you can give a presentation about what you tried and what you learned. Hearing what other people learned is interesting and inspiring for other attendees.</p><br>

    <h1 class="text-xl font-bold" style="padding-bottom:25px;">Judging criteria</h1>

    <p>Teams will be judged on these four criteria. Judges will weigh the criteria equally. During judging, participants should try to describe what they did for each criterion in their project.</p><br>

    <ul>
        <li>
          Technology: How technically impressive was the hack? Was the technical problem the team tackled difficult? Did it use a particularly clever technique or did it use many different components? Did the technology involved make you go &quot;Wow&quot;?  
        </li>
        <li>
          Design: Did the team put thought into the user experience? How well designed is the interface? For a website, this might be about how beautiful the CSS or graphics are. For a hardware project, it might be more about how good the human-computer interaction is (e.g. is it easy to use or does it use a cool interface?).
        </li>
        <li>
          Completion: Does the hack work? Did the team achieve everything they wanted?
        </li>
        <li>
          Learning: Did the team stretch themselves? Did they try to learn something new? What kind of projects have they worked on before? If a team which always does virtual reality projects decides to switch up and try doing a mobile app instead, that exploration should be rewarded.  
        </li>
    </ul><br>

    <p>These criteria will guide judges but ultimately judges are free to make decisions based on their gut feeling of which projects are the most impressive and most deserving.</p><br>

    <p>It&#39;s important to note that these judging criteria do not include:</p><br>

    <ul>
        <li>
          How good your code is. It doesn&#39;t matter if your code is messy, or not well commented, or uses inefficient algorithms. Hacking is about playing around, making mistakes, and learning new things. If your code isn&#39;t production ready, we&#39;re not going to mark you down.  
        </li>
        <li>
          How well you pitch. Hacking is about building and learning, not about selling.
        </li>
        <li>
          How good the idea is. Again, Hackathons aren&#39;t about coming up with innovative ideas. It&#39;s about building and learning.
        </li>
        <li>
          How well the project solves a problem. You can build something totally useless and as long as you&#39;re learning and having fun, that&#39;s a good hack! Sometimes a pointless project is one of the best hacks! 
        </li>
    </ul><br>

    <h1 class="text-xl font-bold" style="padding-bottom:25px;">Travel reimbursement</h1>

    <p>Tl;dr: You can apply for travel reimbursement if you inform us beforehand. We give travel reimbursements of at most 100 euro / person. </p><br>

    <p>If you are attending jacobs<i>Hack</i>! from outside of Bremen, you may apply for travel reimbursement. To receive travel reimbursement, you have to fulfill the following requirements:</p><br>

    <ul>
        <li>
          Contact the jacobs<i>Hack</i>! organizers before the event, but after submitting your application, and inform them that you would like to apply for travel reimbursement along with an estimate amount. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Travel reimbursement receipts submitted before the end of jacobs<i>Hack</i> or before the date specified by the jacobs<i>Hack</i> Team. All receipts must either be in euros, or must have an equivalent value in euro annotated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be part of a team that made a submission to jacobs<i>Hack</i>!. Submissions made solely for the purpose of getting travel reimbursement are against the spirit of this document, and will not be taken into account. 
        </li>
    </ul><br>

    <p>If you have been elected to receive a travel reimbursement, we will contact you after the Hackathon to send it to you. The maximum reimbursement amount per person will be the estimate you provided us beforehand, 100 EUR if you attend jacobs<i>Hack</i>! coming from  outside of Germany, or 25 EUR if you attend jacobs<i>Hack</i>! coming from inside of Germany, whatever is lower.</p><br>

    <p>Several hackers may apply for reimbursement together, however this does not change the maximum amount or conditions for eligibility. </p><br>

    <p>Please note that travel reimbursement is provided solely at the organizers discretion, and that this section does not grant you any legal claim to it whatsoever. </p><br>

    <h1 class="text-xl font-bold" style="padding-bottom:25px;">License Grant &amp; Intellectual Property Rights</h1>

    <p>Tl;dr: Anything you make is yours. However, you allow us to use your submission for promoting jacobs<i>Hack</i>! in the future. </p><br>

    <p>Any submission made by any participant during the jacobs<i>Hack</i>! event remains intellectual property of the respective intellectual property owner. </p><br>

    <p>By making a submission to jacobs<i>Hack</i>, each participant grants jacobs<i>Hack</i>! a worldwide, non-exclusive, fully-paid and royalty-free, perpetual, license to display, modify, transfer, sub-license and in any other way make use of the submission for the purposes of conducting or promoting the jacobs<i>Hack</i>! event (or any future iteration thereof). This grant survives the termination of this agreement.</p><br>
