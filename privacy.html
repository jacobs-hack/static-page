    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold" style="padding-bottom:25px;">Tracking &amp; Cookies Data</h2>

    <p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track the activity on our Service and hold certain information.</p><br>

    <p>Cookies are files with small amount of data which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your device. Tracking technologies also used are beacons, tags, and scripts to collect and track information and to improve and analyze our Service.</p><br>

    <p>You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Service.</p><br>

    <h1 class="text-xl font-bold" style="padding-bottom:25px;">Information Usage</h1>

    <p>We use your data for two primary purposes, (1) to provide and (2) to improve the service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. </p><br>

    <h1 class="text-xl font-bold" style="padding-bottom:25px;">Use of Usage &amp; Tracking Data</h1>

    <h1 class="text-xl font-bold" style="padding-bottom:25px;">Transfer &amp; Usage Of Personal Data</h1>

    <p>Your Personal Data is never transferred outside of Germany except with your explicit permission (e.g. as given by your acceptance of this document). If you are located outside Germany and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the personal data, to Germany and process it here.</p><br>

    <p>JacobsHack! only uses your personal data for specific purposes (see listing in the personal data section above). We only transfer your personal data to selected service providers (see the &ldquo;Data Transfer&rdquo; section below for details), and only for those specific purposes. Furthermore, we will take all steps necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with GDPR.</p><br>

    <h1 class="text-xl font-bold" style="padding-bottom:25px;">Disclosure Of Data</h1>

    <p>The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p><br>

    <p>Furthermore, jacobsHack! strives to never disclose any of your data (both usage data and personal data) without your consent. However, in certain cases we might be required to do so:</p><br>

    <ul>
      <li>To comply with a legal obligation</li>
      <li>To protect and defend the rights or property of jacobs<i>Hack</i>!</li>
      <li>To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service</li>
      <li>To protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public</li>
      <li>To protect against legal liability</li>
    </ul><br>

    <h1 class="text-xl font-bold" style="padding-bottom:25px;">Data Transfer &amp; Service Providers</h1>

    <p>We employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service (&quot;Service Providers&quot;), to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</p><br>

    <p>These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. When using our service, it might thus be required to accept the appropriate Privacy Policies linked below.</p><br>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold" style="padding-bottom:25px;">DevPost</h2>

    <p>To allow us to easily manage a list of submissions at the event, we use the DevPost platform. At the end of the event, participants will be asked to submit their  projects to DevPost. In order to be eligible for a prize, submission to DevPost is required. Submission to DevPost may be subject to the <a href="https://info.devpost.com/privacy">DevPost Privacy Policy</a>.</p><br>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold" style="padding-bottom:25px;">SendGrid</h2>

    <p>SendGrid is a service provider that allows us to easily send an email to all attendees of the event. We thus may submit the names and email addresses of all attendees to SendGrid. For details on how SendGrid uses this data, see the <a href="https://sendgrid.com/policies/privacy/">SendGrid Privacy Policy.</a></p><br>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold" style="padding-bottom:25px;">CDNs</h2>

    <p>Some of our websites use services called Content Delivery Networks (or &ldquo;CDN&rdquo; for short). Instead of hosting shared libraries on our own server, we instead use a third party Content Delivery Network to host it.</p><br>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold" style="padding-bottom:25px;">Sponsors</h2>

    <p>We allow certain third party sponsors to attend the event, to provide mentoring for the participants. In exchange for this service, we offer to send the collected CVs of all participants to these sponsors.</p><br>

    <p>As the list of sponsors is not yet complete, we will therefore explicitly ask for your consent to submit your CV to them at a later point. </p><br>

    <p>Furthermore, while we do not submit any information to the third party sponsors directly, they might collect certain information about the participants at the event. Any such collection is subject to their respective privacy policies.</p><br>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold" style="padding-bottom:25px;">Major League Hacking</h2>

    <p>JacobsHack! is a Major League Hacking (MLH) Event. As such, we are required to share with MLH certain information about you for the purposes of event administration, ranking, MLH administration, pre- and post-event informational e-mails, and occasional messages about hackathons.

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold" style="padding-bottom:25px;">Jacobs University</h2>

    <p>We use Jacobs University Bremen gGmbH as the venue for our event. As such, we might be required to submit certain information about participants of the event to Jacobs University for security purposes. We limit this transfer of information to a minimum and thus will at most submit:</p><br>

    <ul>
      <li>The number of people attending the event</li>
      <li>The names of all participants</li>
      <li>The names of participants who decide to stay in student rooms overnight</li>
    </ul><br>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-bold" style="padding-bottom:25px;">Food Vendors</h2>

    <p>To provide participants with food and drinks at the event, we will employ several food vendors.  To provide us with this service, we will (in anonymized form) submit information about the number of participants and their dietary restrictions to these vendors.</p><br>

    <h1 class="text-xl font-bold" style="padding-bottom:25px;">Links To Other Sites</h1>
    
    <p>Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party&#39;s site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.</p><br>

    <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p><br>
    
    <h1 class="text-xl font-bold" style="padding-bottom:25px;">Children&#39;s Privacy</h1>

    <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 (&quot;Children&quot;).</p><br>
